Goal: To identify processes with varying levels of employee utilization to determine where interventions such as cost reduction, efficiency improvements, or automation might be needed.
2. Methodology
Data Collection: Gather data on the total number of FTEs involved in each process and the average FTEs required.
FTE Impact Calculation: Calculate the FTE impact for each process by multiplying the Total FTE by the average FTE.
3. Analysis
High FTE Impact: Identify processes with a high FTE impact, indicating higher utilization of employees.
Low FTE Impact: Identify processes with a low FTE impact, indicating lower utilization and potential inefficiencies.
4. Findings
High-Impact Processes: These are the processes where a large number of FTEs are heavily utilized. Investigate if these processes are critical and require such high involvement or if there are opportunities for optimization.
Low-Impact Processes: These processes might be overstaffed or not fully optimized. They could be candidates for automation or reallocation of resources.
5. Conclusion
Effective Utilization: Determine which processes make effective use of employee time and which do not.
Intervention Needs: Highlight processes that require intervention to improve efficiency or reduce costs.
6. Recommendations
Automate Low-Impact Processes: Identify repetitive and low-value tasks within these processes that can be automated.
Optimize High-Impact Processes: Look for ways to streamline high-impact processes, possibly through better workflow management or technology integration.
Reallocate Resources: Adjust staffing levels to better align with the actual needs of each process.
