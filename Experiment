Handling Blank Comments:
Identify Patterns:
Check for commonalities in recon types, dates, or other variables where comments are missing.
Compare with Filled Comments:
Analyze if the data with blank comments has any significant differences compared to those with filled comments.
Investigate Causes:
Engage with recon handlers to understand possible reasons for blank comments (e.g., data entry issues, lack of information, procedural lapses).
