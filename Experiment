Subject: Update on Asset Servicing Capacity Tracking Project (Phase 1) and Request for Handover

Dear Kewal/Huzefa,

I am writing to provide an update on the Python code development for the asset servicing capacity tracking project (Phase 1). I've been making steady progress, but due to a recent shift in priorities requiring my focus on the OTC confirms team, I won't be able to dedicate the necessary time for timely completion.

Considering this, I'd like to propose handing over the remaining Phase 1 tasks to Soham, who has also been involved in the project. Soham's familiarity with the codebase and the project goals will ensure a smooth transition. I'm happy to provide any handover documentation or answer any questions Soham may have to facilitate a seamless continuation.

While I transition to my new priorities, I'll certainly offer support to Soham whenever possible. However, I believe Soham taking the lead will allow for more focused development and ensure timely completion of Phase 1.

Please let me know if you have any questions or require further details.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
