### Introduction
- **Overview of the Dataset**:
  - The dataset contains various attributes related to confirms, including `Unique Eventid`, `ROC`, `Age`, `Age Band`, `Counterparty Name`, `Business Event`, `Product Representation`, `Days Spent`, and `Action Items`.
  - The goal is to understand the lifecycle of confirms, identify bottlenecks, and enhance process efficiency.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Loading and Cleaning**:
  - The dataset is loaded and cleaned to ensure all necessary columns are correctly formatted and usable.
  - Combined some `ROCs` or stages into a new column named `Action Items` for more meaningful analysis.

### Analysis 1: Identify the Most Prevalent Combinations of ROC and Age Band
- **Objective**: Determine which combinations of `ROC` and `Age Band` contribute most to the increase in the age of `Unique Eventid`.
- **Method**:
  - For each `Unique Eventid`, identify the combination of `ROC` and `Age Band` where it spent the most time.
  - Calculate the percentage of events where each combination is the highest contributor to the age.
- **Findings**:
  - Provided insights into which stages and combinations are the biggest contributors to the overall age of confirms.

### Analysis 2: Top 3 Clusters Within Each ROC and Age Band Combination
- **Objective**: Identify the top 3 combinations of `Legal Entity`, `Business Event`, and `Product Representation` within each `ROC` and `Age Band` combination.
- **Method**:
  - For each `ROC` and `Age Band` combination, determine the most frequent combinations of `Legal Entity`, `Business Event`, and `Product Representation`.
- **Findings**:
  - Highlighted key clusters within each `ROC` and `Age Band` combination, providing a deeper understanding of the distribution and behavior of confirms.

### Analysis 3: Counterparty Performance
- **Objective**: Evaluate the performance of different counterparties by identifying the top 3 `ROC` and `Age Band` combinations where they spend the most time.
- **Method**:
  - For each `Counterparty Name` and `Unique Eventid` combination, calculate the average time spent in each `ROC` and `Age Band`.
  - Identify the top 3 combinations contributing to the total time spent.
- **Findings**:
  - Provided a performance overview of counterparties, highlighting which `ROC` and `Age Band` combinations are most problematic.

### Analysis 4: Filtering for Closed ROC Status
- **Objective**: Isolate data for `Unique Eventid` that have a closed status in `ROC` at any point.
- **Method**:
  - Filter the dataset to keep all rows for `Unique Eventid` that have at least one occurrence of a closed status in `ROC`.
- **Findings**:
  - Enabled a focused analysis on confirms that have reached a closed status, distinguishing them from those still open.

### Analysis 5: Count of Unique Eventids
- **Objective**: Determine the count of unique `Unique Eventid` with and without a closed status in `ROC`.
- **Method**:
  - Calculate the number of unique `Unique Eventid` that have at least one closed status in `ROC`.
  - Calculate the number of unique `Unique Eventid` that do not have any closed status in `ROC`.
- **Findings**:
  - Provided a clear count of how many confirms have reached closure versus those that have not.

### Analysis 6: Transition Probability Matrix
- **Objective**: Understand the likelihood of moving from one `Action Item` to another.
- **Method**:
  - Create a transition matrix showing the probabilities of moving from one `Action Item` to the next within the lifecycle of a confirm.
- **Findings**:
  - Highlighted common transition paths and potential areas to streamline the confirm process.

### Analysis 7: Action Item Impact Analysis
- **Objective**: Determine the impact of different `Action Items` on the overall age of confirms.
- **Method**:
  - Calculate the total time spent in each `Action Item` for each `Unique Eventid`.
  - Analyze how changes in `Action Items` affect the total age of confirms.
- **Findings**:
  - Identified which `Action Items` have the most significant impact on the overall age, enabling targeted process improvements.

### Conclusion
- **Summary of Findings**:
  - Comprehensive analysis of the confirm lifecycle using `ROC` and `Age Band` combinations provided detailed insights.
  - Identified key bottlenecks, performance issues, and impactful stages within the confirm process.
  - Recommendations for targeted interventions and process improvements to enhance efficiency.

### Future Work
- **Further Analysis**:
  - Deeper dive into variable values to identify factors that increase the likelihood of confirms getting stuck in specific `ROC` and `Age Band` combinations.
  - Continuous monitoring and adjustment based on newly emerging patterns and trends.
