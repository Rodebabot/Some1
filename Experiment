When analyzing the life cycle of confirms, it's crucial to consider the combination of `ROC` and `Age Band` rather than just `ROC` alone. Here’s why:

1. **Iteration and Life Cycle Complexity**: Confirms often go through multiple iterations within their life cycle. A confirm might exit a specific `ROC` and re-enter it later. Simply summing the days spent in a particular `ROC` doesn’t capture this complexity accurately.

2. **Detailed Stage Analysis**: By combining `ROC` and `Age Band`, we can see not only the `ROC` but also the specific stage (`Age Band`) within that `ROC`. This provides a more detailed picture of how long a confirm spends at each stage within a `ROC`, offering insights into the behavior and progression of confirms through their life cycle.

3. **Meaningful Insights**: Summing the days spent in a `ROC` without considering the `Age Band` can lead to misleading conclusions. For example, a confirm might spend 5 days in `ROC` during an early stage (`0-5` days) and another 10 days in a later stage (`10-15` days) of the same `ROC`. Simply summing these gives 15 days in `ROC`, which doesn’t reflect the different stages and behaviors. By analyzing the `ROC` and `Age Band` combination, we can see that it spent different amounts of time in distinct stages, providing a clearer and more meaningful understanding of its lifecycle.

4. **Behavioral Patterns**: Combining `ROC` with `Age Band` helps identify specific patterns and bottlenecks within each `ROC`. For instance, we might find that confirms get stuck longer in certain `ROCs` at specific stages. This level of detail is essential for improving processes and resolving issues within the lifecycle of confirms.

5. **Deep Dive into Variables**: Additionally, this approach allows us to deep dive and analyze which specific variable values contribute to a confirm ending up in particular `ROC` and `Age Band` combinations. By identifying these variables and their values, we can understand the factors that increase the likelihood of confirms getting stuck in certain stages. This insight is crucial for proactive management and optimization of the confirm process.

In summary, using the combination of `ROC` and `Age Band` allows for a more nuanced and accurate analysis, reflecting the true complexity and behavior of confirms as they move through their lifecycle stages. Moreover, it enables us to identify and understand the key variables that influence these stages, leading to more effective decision-making and process improvements.
