## Business Problem:

* High frequency of breaks in the operational flow is causing delays and impacting overall efficiency.
* Understanding the reasons behind these breaks can help identify areas for improvement.

## Analytical Problem:

* Analyze unstructured text data (comments or reasons) associated with breaks.
* Identify the underlying themes and categorize the breaks based on their causes.

## Methods:

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
    * Preprocess text data (cleaning, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization).
    * Extract keywords and identify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) in comments.
* **Topic Modeling (Themes & Categories):**
    * Use techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover hidden topics (themes) in the comments.
    * Group similar comments under these themes, creating categories for break reasons.

**Additional Considerations:**

* You can explore sentiment analysis within themes to understand if specific break types are more frustrating or disruptive.
* Depending on the volume of data, consider using pre-trained NLP models or cloud-based solutions for efficiency.

These bullet points outline the business problem, analytical problem, and methods you can use with NLP and topic modeling to analyze break reasons and identify areas for improvement in your operational flow.
