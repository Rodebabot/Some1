I initiated this project and have made significant progress, including developing the dashboard in collaboration with Sufyan. The majority of the heavy lifting has been completed.

The remaining task is to clean and prepare the input data for the system. I believe transferring ownership at this stage will allow for a seamless handover and enable the project to be completed efficiently.
