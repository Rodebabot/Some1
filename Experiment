Certainly! Here's a more presentable version using bullet points:

### Business Problem:
- **Issue:** High frequency of breaks in the operational flow.
- **Impact:** Causing delays and impacting overall efficiency.
- **Objective:** Understanding the reasons behind these breaks to identify areas for improvement.

### Analytical Problem:
- **Focus:** Understanding reasons for breaks where comments are not mentioned through data plotting and distribution mapping.
- **Goal:** Finding if there are any variables particularly affecting the data.

### Methods:
1. **Variable Analysis:**
   - Plotting each variable recon-wise for each business date.
   - Generating frequency charts (Histograms) to get data distribution.
   
2. **Topic Modeling (Themes & Categories):**
   - **Clustering:** Grouping different variables of same recons to cluster similar trades.
   - **Histogram Plotting:** Determining changes in data distribution on a monthly basis.

### Action Required:
- **Request:** Kindly connect with the following people based on MO Owners as indicated in TLM breaks data for the top 5 recons:
   - **TOTORI vs LCH CASH & PORTFOLIO:** Nilesh Jain
   - **EUCLID vs EUCLID:** Nirav Soni, Shane McQuade
   - **TOTORO vs JSCC:** [No names mentioned]
   - **AXL vs AXL INTER COMPANY:** Shekhar Parptadter, Philippe Girard, Nirav Soni, Shane McQuade
   - **AXIAL vs APEX:** Philippe Girard, Roger Low, Ricky Shah

- **Note:** Since there is no factor affecting the variables from data visualization, we need to speak with the MO recon handlers to understand if there are any prevailing conditions due to which they do not comment on these breaks. These are the largest recons by volume based on data from Jan - May 2024.
