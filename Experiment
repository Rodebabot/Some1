Validations
1. If payment type is OTC Net CF then the model checks gross level payment types, consolidates it using product-payment consolidation. If a new payment type is flowed in from FO system then the model marks it as NSTP and separates that flow for the retraining cycle.
2. If product Type is blank then treat that flow as NSTP
3. The STP/NSTP classification from the model is purely based on threshold (95%) based on historical validation testing. If, with historical evidence a similar flow has 95% chance of success, only then will the model classify it as STP.
Assumptions
1. If any flow has blanks in confirmation status, then it will be treated as not executed.
2. If any new flow -(new product,payment, counterparty) flows in to the model for which the model has no historical data, it will mark it as NSTP and separate that flow for retraining cycle.
