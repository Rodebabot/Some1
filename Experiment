**Project Documentation: Task Distribution Model for CS-G KYC Team**

**1. Objectives:**

The primary goal of this project is to develop a statistical model that optimally distributes tasks among members of the CS-G KYC team based on task complexity, employee skill levels, and tenure. The objectives include:

- Efficient allocation of tasks to enhance team productivity.
- Utilization of individual skills to maximize overall team performance.
- Forecasting future workloads and adjusting task assignments accordingly.

**2. Types of Variables or Data Sets Needed:**

a. **Independent Variables:**

   i. Task Complexity: A scale to measure the complexity of each KYC task.
   
   ii. Employee Skill Levels: Categorized based on tenure, experience, and expertise.
   
   iii. Time: Monthly data to analyze workload variations.

b. **Dependent Variables:**

   i. Task Allocation: Number of tasks assigned to each team member.

**3. Data Collection:**

- Task Complexity: Extracted from historical task data, considering factors like regulatory changes and document intricacy.
  
- Employee Skill Levels: HR records, performance evaluations, and feedback.

- Time: Monthly records of completed tasks and future workload projections.

**4. Timeline:**

| Phase            | Duration         |
|------------------|------------------|
| Data Collection  | 1 month          |
| Model Development| 2 months         |
| Testing & Refinement | 1 month      |
| Implementation   | 1 month          |
| Evaluation & Adjustment | Ongoing  |

**5. Tools and Techniques:**

a. **Tools:**
   
   i. Python for statistical analysis and model development.
   
   ii. Excel for data preprocessing and initial analysis.
   
   iii. SQL for database queries and data retrieval.

b. **Techniques:**

   i. Regression Analysis: To understand the relationship between variables.
   
   ii. Machine Learning Algorithms: Depending on the complexity, decision trees or ensemble methods can be explored.
   
   iii. Time Series Analysis: For forecasting future workloads.

**6. Data Analysis:**

| Data Type       | Analysis Type                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Task Complexity | Regression Analysis              |
| Skill Levels    | Classification or Clustering      |
| Time            | Time Series Analysis              |

**7. Model Evaluation:**

- Accuracy of task allocation compared to actual performance.
- Regular feedback from team members on workload distribution.

**8. Expected Output:**

- Optimized task assignments.
- Insights into resource utilization and team performance.
- Ability to adapt task distribution based on changing conditions.

This project documentation provides a comprehensive outline for developing a task distribution model for the CS-G KYC team. Adjustments may be necessary based on ongoing evaluation and feedback.
